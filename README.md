Problem statement:
Increase the sense of community and improve the UMSL app experience.

Vision Statement:
To provide one location for students and staff to post, search, and subscribe to UMSL events. 

What our app does:
It is an app and website that allows users to subscribe and/or explore various UMSL events.  Users may search, view, and subscribe to events they might otherwise miss out on. (Example: Nursing students can subscribe to get notifications about Business Student events)
 
How will our program help the professors as well as the students?
Triton Life will reach wider audiences, no extra work for them to post events, increase participation, and provide data on event participation. 

Professors can:
Post and search events.
See who attended events (students from what school).
Professors and Deanâ€™s can get matrix on events (what do students attend).

Students can:
See a list of things that they attended.
Bulk up their resume. 
Review class schedules and events.
Receive notifications about other events on campus or outside of their program.
Organize social meetups with other students based on interest.
Get intelligence on items that other students may have attended (Amazon type learning).
    
Organizers can:
Synchronize schedules based on other campus events.
View room availability.
Reach a larger student base.
Use data to plan events that attract attendees.
